# Sentence Similarity II
We can represent a sentence as an array of words, for example, the sentence "I am happy with leetcode" can be represented as arr = ["I","am",happy","with","leetcode"].

Given two sentences sentence1 and sentence2 each represented as a string array and given an array of string pairs similarPairs where similarPairs[i] = [xi, yi] indicates that the two words xi and yi are similar.

Return true if sentence1 and sentence2 are similar, or false if they are not similar.

Two sentences are similar if:

1. They have the same length (i.e., the same number of words)
2. sentence1[i] and sentence2[i] are similar.

Notice that a word is always similar to itself, also notice that the similarity relation is transitive. For example, if the words a and b are similar, and the words b and c are similar, then a and c are similar.
